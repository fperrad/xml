XML on Parrot
=============

This module contains :
 * a SAX like parser
 * a simple handler XmlWriter

There are toys, but there demonstrate the power of PCT,
the Parrot Compiler Toolkit.

But PCT is not handly for packaging & deployment.

Now, XML modules could easy implemented with Perl 6,
because with PCT, most of the code is already Perl 6.
